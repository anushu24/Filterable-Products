In this project I designed a webpage using React library to show a list of product and filtered using different criteria such as: category, color, price and/or rating.
The searched results are paginated
The filtered have differents logic, for instance: category and rating filters are enabled by clickable elements, color and price are accessed by typing in input elements that allow dinamically filter the products.
